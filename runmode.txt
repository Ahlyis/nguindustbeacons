I prefer launching the program from a command prompt, though you can set up
a batch file or Windows shortcut if you prefer. If you do, I recommend
setting the command line arguments to redirect the output to a text file. If
you don't, the entire thing will barf out onto the little dos window. I
launch the file as such (your directories will probably be different):

c:\dev\ngu-indust\Alchemy.exe > Output.txt

Just make sure Alchemy.exe, runmode.txt and the <map>.txt files
are all in the same directory.
