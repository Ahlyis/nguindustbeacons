Program for placing beacons in NGU Industries

This is a simple console app. It doesn't have fancy graphics or a beautiful UI.

I wrote this purely for my own use, to help me figure out good beacon placement in NGU Industries idle game. But some on the discord requested to see the code, so here it is.

Most of the "how to use this" instructions can be found in runmode.txt. Again, this was mostly written for my own use, so don't expect detailed walkthroughs of everything!
